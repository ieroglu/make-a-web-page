<p the article itself="type it> Unveiling <a href=”http://www.biophysics.org/">the principles of protein conformational changes</a> is one of the most challenging research topics over the past few decades.Because protein`s three dimensional structures are highly flexible and sensitive to  environment, a wide range of motions with timescales from femtosecond to millisecond is responsible for the overall conformational changes.<br>

<p style="color:red">Characterizing factional states of proteins</p> and determining transition rates between them is necessary to understand how the environment initiates protein conformational changes. <p style="font-family:verdana">Therefore,</p> <p style="text-size:160%">an advanced approach with both high and temporal resolution is indispensable for probing protein structures at the atomic level and dynamics on a short timescale. </p> The report by <b> Baiz and Tokmakoff</b> in this issue of <i>Biophysical Journal</i> is an excellent <strong>demonstration</strong> of the combination of advanced experimental and theoretical approaches to characterizing protein conformational <em>heterogeneity</em> on subpicosecond timescale.<mark>Two dimensional infrared spectroscopy</mark> is one of the most powerful approaches to studying biological systems.<del> this is my idea though</del>. <ins>Ilike to add my comment on that point</ins> It makes use of a series of <sub>femtoseconds</sub> laser pulses with careful selected time delays between them to probe system structure and <sup>dynamics</sup>.  This information can than be extractesd by monotoring the SC <q>spectral changes</q> as function of time delays. Because the time resolution of 2D <abbr title="infrared">IR</abbr> is measured on subpicosecond timescales, the quickest conformational changes of <cite>biomolecules</cite> appear static, and thus can be probed. Theoptical active amid I vibration(<var>C</var>=<var>O</var> streching), which is naturally present in peptides and proteins is one of the most popular excitation probe by 2D IR spectroscopy.<!--I can add coment or hide something here-->
  <p style="border:1px solid grey; padding:7px">The 2D IR spectrum carries information about the magnitude and time scale of the elctric field fluctuation in the invoriment of amide I groups.</p>Due to complexity of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_infrared_spectroscopy">2D IR specrum</a>, it is hard to directly translate the spectral information into structural and dynamical information at the atomic level.
